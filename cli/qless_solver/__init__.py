# This file makes Python treat the directory qless_solver as a package.

# Optionally, you can make specific classes or functions available for easier import, e.g.:
# from .grid_solver import Grid, PlacedWord, GridPosition, solve_qless_grid
# from .solver import solve_qless # Example if you have other solvers
# from .dictionary import Dictionary
# from .dice import Dice # etc.

# For now, leave it empty or with comments, specific exports can be added as needed.
